# Attribute Validation (Optional) for Console Commands & Models (Task 2)

Add a validation layer for attributes passed via the console (for example, ensure that 'number_rooms' in 'Place' is an integer, or that 'email' in 'User' follows a specific format). This will need to be implemented in each specific model. This validation is not mandatory to meet the initial requirements, but it could enhance the robustness of the application.

Additional tests: Add additional unit tests to check that models are correctly initialized with dynamic attributes and that attribute validations, if you choose to add them, work as expected.

Documentation: Update code documentation to reflect these new capabilities and, if validations are added, document the validation rules for each attribute in the models concerned.
